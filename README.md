# Numerical Integrator Analysis

This project investigates the numerical stability and energy conservation properties of different integration methods applied to the two-body gravitational problem.

Planned Methods:
- Euler
- RK2
- RK4
- Verlet

Goals:
- Compare energy drift
- Compare angular momentum conservation
- Analyze long-term stability
- Study timestep sensitivity
